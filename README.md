# YogaOnRails

Welcome to YogaOnRails, a web application for yoga instructors to track and manage their yoga classes, studios, and students. Classes are listed by date in the yoga class index. Users can add students to their individual classes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed Ruby v2.6.1 or a later version. Ensure you also have Rails installed.

## Usage

To use YogaOnRails, download a zipped file from Github (https://github.com/beth-ruff/Yoga_on_rails). 

After saving the contents to the desired directory, run 'bundle install'.

From within that directory (cd <directory_name>), run 'rails s' in your terminal, then open 'localhost:3000' (or the listening port stated in your terminal) in a web browser.

When closing the program, type 'contrl/command + C' in your terminal to exit rails console.
